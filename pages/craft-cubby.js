          The Craft Cubby is our own take on the Little Free Library! Located at
          Second Shift in Logan Square, we have a craft supply stash that is
          ‚Äútake what you need, and leave what you don‚Äôt‚Äù. If you‚Äôre like us and
          hoard so many hobby supplies that you don‚Äôt plan on using, donate it
          to another crafter in need. Want to try a new hobby but can‚Äôt afford
          all of the new supplies? Come browse the free supply stash!

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is the parking situation like?</h3>
        <p>
          It is street parking only. You can also park in the residential areas
          to the West of Second Shift. Do NOT park in the lot next to Second
          Shift, as you will be towed.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I really take anything? Even for a friend?</h3>
        <p>
          Of course! Please just only take what you or your friend need, and
          please be conscious of other craft club members who use the cubby. We
          want everyone to have the opportunity to take something they need.
        </p>
