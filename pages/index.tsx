              Welcome to the Chicago Craft Club! We&apos;re a group of
              passionate 18+ artists and crafters from all over the creative
              spectrum living in the Chicagoland area.

              This group is about meeting fellow crafters that are passionate
              about crafting and community, learning from each other, and just
              plain ol&apos; hanging out.
